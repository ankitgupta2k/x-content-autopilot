# Ideas → Impact

I build practical, shippable solutions that turn real-world ideas into working systems.

This repo is the **hub** — a simple index of projects and what they’re trying to solve.

---

## Projects

### 🚧 x-content-autopilot
**AI-driven daily X content autopilot** — generates posts from a ruleset + prompt templates, applies guardrails (length, tone, duplicates), then posts/schedules and logs results.

- Repo: https://github.com/ankitgupta2k/x-content-autopilot
- Status: In progress

---

## What you’ll find here
- Project links + short context
- Roadmaps and “why” behind each build
- An “Ideas → Impact” approach: fewer demos, more usable systems

---

## Principles
- Build for reliability first
- Keep automation safe and compliant
- Measure outcomes and iterate (reach, engagement, learning)
